##  Discover Nice Neighborhoods From Yelp Restaurant Features and Reviews
## Using Big Data Techniques

## Author: Cheng Hou, Le Xu, Xiaomeng Dong, Yubo Li
For this big data analysis project, our goal is to
detect the spatial patterns of businesses
according to different features, such as price
levels, types, stars ratings and review contents,
to better understand the weekly changes and
the trends of urban dwellers’ activities, and
then we would like to incorporate the business
data with neighborhoods, in order to classify
the neighborhoods into different subgroups
based on the given features using Clustering or
Decision Tree machine learning algorithms.
The inspiration came from questions like: Why
Michelin 4 stars restaurants are always around
the Central Park, Upper East Side? Or where
can we open a new trendy ramen restaurant
targeting young students population?
Our hypothesis: ​we believe ​there is a strong
correlation of the business features and
neighborhood features. It is possible to classify
neighborhoods based on the restaurant's
features within this neighborhood.
